Title TBD

Abstract

We may think that a successful movie is defined by its revenue, the higher the income and the better the film. In this project, we want to go way beyond the mere revenue information. We are going to exploit the rating of movies as well as the inflation, to determine whether there is a temporal link between how much people seem to love a film and how much the film is actually earning. Once we have a better understanding of this mechanism, we would like to find which are the most popular movie genres in each of the 20th century decades. Are we going to detect the golden age of the Far West and Science Fiction movies? In addition, how fast do movie preferences change with time?

Research Questions

Check if there is correlation between the ratings and the revenues (corrected with inflation).
Find a metric that define if a movie is popular by taking into account the ratings and the corrected revenues.
Explore the most popular movies defined by our metric, and detect which movie genres were likely to be watched and appreciated during the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.
Perform a temporal analysis of the changes of the popular movie genres.
