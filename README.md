# Title TBD

___Study of the evolution of movie success across time___

## Abstract

We may think that a successful movie is defined by its revenue, the higher the income and the better the film. In this project, we want to go way beyond the mere revenue information. We are going to exploit the rating of movies as well as the inflation, to determine whether there is a temporal link between how much people seem to love a film and how much the film is actually earning. At this point we must not forget that the budget of a movie can impact it's success, it may be a link between the budget, the revenue and the rating. Once we have a better understanding of this mechanism, we would like to find which are the most successful movie genres in each of the 20th century decades. We may detect the golden age of the Far West and Science Fiction movies and it would be interesting to analyse how fast movie preferences change with time.

## Research Questions

Perform a temporal analysis of the changes of the popular movie genres.

1) Is there a link between revenue, budget and rating?
2) Which movie genres were likely to be watched and appreciated during the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century?
3) How fast do popular movie genres change across time?
